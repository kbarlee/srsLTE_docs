srsLTE Application Notes
=========================

srsLTE is a free and open-source 4G LTE software suite. Using srsLTE, you can build an end-to-end software radio mobile network.
For more information, see `www.srslte.com <https://www.srslte.com>`_. These application notes provide guides for specific srsLTE use-cases.
